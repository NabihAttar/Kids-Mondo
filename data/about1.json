    "text": "Every great city begins with a vision and so is KidzMondo, brought to life by four symbolic founders who turned imagination into order and play into purpose. Kozmo, the bold explorer embodies curiosity and courage where he's the drive to go beyond. Ëena, the thoughtful creator, represents the mind — innovation, learning, and discovery. Dogzilla, the steadfast guardian, stands for protection, loyalty, and strength. And Leeloo, the quiet sage, carries the wisdom that binds them all together. Together, they made the KidzMondo Constitution, a promise that every child would grow in a world built on respect, equality, and empathy. Their spirit shapes everything within the city: its culture, its play, and its purpose. Through them, KidzMondo isn’t just imagined, it’s governed by values that turn every child into a citizen of possibility. ",
